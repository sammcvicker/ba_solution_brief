    GROUP 3 IMPLEMENTATION:
    Generate a PDF document from the structured model data.

    This function should:
    - Take the structured data model from Group 2
    - Create a well-formatted PDF document using the model data
    - Apply appropriate styling, layout, and formatting
    - Handle different types of content (text, tables, images, etc.)
    - Return the PDF as bytes for download

    Args:
        model: Structured data model containing processed information from Group 2
        context: Optional raw context string (in case you need additional context)

    Returns:
        bytes: PDF document as binary data ready for download

    Notes:
    - YOU SHOULD CREATE YOUR OWN MODEL STRUCTURE FOR TESTING - since Group 2's model may not be ready
    - Consider using libraries like reportlab, weasyprint, or fpdf for PDF generation
    - Think about document structure: headers, sections, formatting, page breaks
    - Handle cases where model data might be incomplete or missing
    - Consider adding features like table of contents, page numbers, headers/footers
    - Test with your own model structure initially, integration will happen later
    - Focus on creating a professional-looking document output
    - Consider error handling for PDF generation failures

    Example libraries you might use:
    - reportlab: Good for programmatic PDF creation
    - weasyprint: HTML/CSS to PDF conversion
    - jinja2 + weasyprint: Template-based PDF generation
    """
    # TODO: Group 3 - Implement PDF document generation
    # Create your own test model structure for development
    # This is a placeholder implementation that returns empty PDF bytes

    # Placeholder: Return minimal PDF bytes (this won't be a valid PDF)
    # Replace this with actual PDF generation logic
    return b"%PDF-1.4\n%placeholder PDF content for testing\n%%EOF"
