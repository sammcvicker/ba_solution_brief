    GROUP 2 IMPLEMENTATION:
    Analyze the extracted context and create a structured data model.

    This function should:
    - Parse and analyze the context string from Group 1
    - Extract key information, themes, or data points
    - Structure the information into a well-defined Pydantic model
    - Apply any business logic for categorization or processing
    - Return a populated model instance that Group 3 can use for document generation

    Args:
        context: Raw text content extracted from uploaded documents

    Returns:
        BaseModel: Structured data model containing processed information

    Notes:
    - YOU SHOULD CREATE YOUR OWN MODEL STRUCTURE - the DocumentModel above is just a placeholder
    - Consider what information Group 3 will need to generate the final document
    - Think about data validation and proper typing for your model fields
    - You might want to use AI/LLM services to extract structured data from unstructured text
    - Consider error handling for malformed or insufficient context
    - The model structure will be finalized later, so focus on what makes sense for your processing
