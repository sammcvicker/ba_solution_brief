    GROUP 1 IMPLEMENTATION:
    Extract and consolidate context/content from uploaded documents.

    This function should:
    - Read and parse various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
    - Extract text content from each file
    - Combine/consolidate the content into a single context string
    - Handle different file types appropriately
    - Return clean, structured text that can be used for further processing

    Args:
        files: List of uploaded files from the FastAPI endpoint

    Returns:
        str: Consolidated text content from all uploaded files

    Notes:
    - Consider handling different file formats (PDF, Word docs, images with OCR, etc.)
    - Think about how to structure the combined content (concatenation, sections, etc.)
    - Handle potential encoding issues and file corruption gracefully
    - You may want to preserve some metadata about which content came from which file
